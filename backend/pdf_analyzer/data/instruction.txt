  "overview": { "title": "", "course_id": "", "description": "", "learning_objectives": [""] },
  "schedule": {
	"lecture"	: [ {"date": "", "duration": 0} ],
	"lab"    	: [ {"date": "", "duration": 0} ],
	"office_hour": [ {"date": "", "duration": 0} ]
  },
  "important_events": [ {"name": "", "date": ""} ],
  "grading": {
	"breakdown": [ {"name": "", "weight": 0} ],

	}
  ],
