You are tasked with organizing a university course syllabus into the following JSON format:

{
  "overview": { "title": "", "course_id": "", "professor": "", "description": "", "learning_objectives": [""] },
  "contact": [ {"name" : "", "role" : "", "contact": ""} ],
  "schedule": {
	"lecture"	: [ {"date": "", "duration": 0} ],
	"lab"    	: [ {"date": "", "duration": 0} ],
	"office_hour": [ {"date": "", "duration": 0} ]
  },
  "important_events": [ {"name": "", "date": ""} ],
  "grading": {
	"breakdown": [ {"name": "", "weight": 0} ],
	"cutoff": [ {"mark": "", "minimum_percentage": 0, "maximum_percentage": 0} ]
  },
  "graded_items": [
	{
  	"title": "",
  	"summary": "",
  	"important_info": [ {"info": ""} ]
	}
  ],
  "policies": [
	{
  	"title": "",
  	"summary": "",
  	"important_info": [ {"info": ""} ]
	}
  ],
  "textbook_resources": [ {"name": "", "required": false} ]
}

- Names of people should be composed of first name, middle name, and last name (e.g. George Bunch Adams).
- Course ID should be composed of a course name abbreviation and a five digit ID (e.g. ENGL10600). Leave the last two digits 0 if only three digits are provided
- Output JSON data only. Do not format in markdown, just plain text. Do not provide any explanations for your output.
